Here are my ZShell and VIM configs

#### Zshell
  * I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
  * My configurations and plugins go to .zshrc file

#### VIM
  * I use [Vundle Package Manager](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
  * It's included in this repo (Better if you update)
  * Configurations and Plugins I use you can see .vimrc file
  * Don't forget to run `:PluginInstall`

When you clone this repo, you can install everything to system by running `./save.js`.
Dependency for that is `node.js`
